# Blinkit Sales Analysis using Python

## Objective
To conduct a detailed analysis of Blinkit's sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution using key performance indicators and data visualizations. The analysis aims to uncover actionable insights and identify optimization opportunities in product offerings and outlet strategy.

## Dataset

## KPI Requirements
The following key performance indicators were used for analysis:
- Total Sales: The overall revenue generated from all items sold.
- Average Sales: The average revenue per item sold.
- Number of Items: The total count of different items sold.
- Average Rating: The average customer rating for items sold.

## Chart Requirements
- Total Sales by Fat Content : Analyze the impact of fat content on total sales.
- Total Sales by Item Type : Identify the performance of different item types.
- Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales : Compare fat content performance across different outlet types.
- Total Sales by Outlet Establishment Year : Evaluate how the age of an outlet influences sales.
- Sales by Outlet Size : Analyze the correlation between outlet size and total sales.
- Sales by Outlet Location : Assess geographic distribution of sales across locations.

## Process
- Data Cleaning: Removed nulls, encoded categorical data, and normalized formats.
- KPI Calculation: Computed total and average metrics using grouped dataframes.
- Visualization: Used Python libraries (matplotlib, seaborn) to create charts.
- Insight Extraction: Evaluated each visualization to derive strategic takeaways.
